# Football Talent Identification

This repository contains the final project for a football talent identification and match outcome prediction system.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to design a data-driven system that supports football talent identification by combining:
- Text-based player attributes
- Video-based movement analysis (pose estimation)
- Match outcome prediction using statistical team features

The system is designed as a lightweight and fast prototype suitable for academic use and future extension.

## 🧩 Project Stages

### 1️⃣ Text-Based Talent Identification
Player attributes such as age, height, weight, training experience, sprint time, stamina, passing ability, and shot power are used to predict the talent level of a football player.

**Output:**
- Talent level: Beginner / Semi-Professional / Professional
- Class probabilities

---

### 2️⃣ Video-Based Movement Analysis (Pose Estimation)
Short football videos (e.g. running or shooting) are analyzed using pose estimation techniques to extract movement-related indicators such as:
- Knee angle
- Hip angle
- Movement stability

This stage helps assess the quality of player movement and technique.

---

### 3️⃣ Match Outcome Prediction
Using team-level features such as team ratings, recent form, and expected goals (xG), the system predicts:
- Home Win
- Draw
- Away Win  
along with the probability of each outcome.
